**Traffic Percentage**

Our idea is to count the cars going on a certain street, and return a live percentage of the traffic jam. If the percentage reaches a certain point, it will send an alarm.

This project would save people from getting stuck in a traffic jam

The minimum required is the general object detection

**PM**

for the project management, we are going to use Trello, to divide all the tasks and focus on the workflow of the project
